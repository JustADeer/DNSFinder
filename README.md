DNSFinder is a Python-based tool designed to help users analyze and manage DNS data. It reads from a `dnsdata.json` file and provides functionality for searching, filtering, or processing DNS records. The project is intended for educational purposes, quick DNS lookups, or as a starting point for more advanced DNS management tools.

## Features

- Reads DNS data from a JSON file (`dnsdata.json`)
- Provides search and lookup capabilities for DNS records
- Simple and easy-to-use Python script (`DNSFinder.py`)
- Can be run via the included batch file (`run.bat`) on Windows

## Usage

1. Place your DNS data in `dnsdata.json` in the project directory.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```powershell
   python DNSFinder.py
   ```
   Or use the batch file:
   ```powershell
   .\run.bat
   ```
3. Follow the prompts or instructions in the script to interact with your DNS data.
